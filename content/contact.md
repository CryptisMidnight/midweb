{{< /tip >}}
For technology consulting, rates are the same in-person or over the phone at $20 per/hr. This includes but is not limited to: Q&As, formulating solutions, presentations, and referrals. Maintenance and upkeep of any solution is your responsibility. You may be charged for additional consultations and troubleshooting.

Repair services are $20 per/hr. In most cases, you can supply your own parts or order them yourself so that you can easily maintain the warranties. On PC builds, this is required. Travel expenses may be added depending on the size of the job and distance. No surprise expenses; all costs will be laid out in advance. In most cases, there is a warranty on my repairs. The duration varies, depending on the job, though.
